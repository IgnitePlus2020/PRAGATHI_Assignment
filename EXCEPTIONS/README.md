Develop a method that accepts a zip code and validates against non-deliverable zip codes.

• Example – zip codes 123, 456, 789 are non-deliverable.

• If the customer resides at a non-deliverable zip code, throw a custom exception.

• Handle the exception and display an appropriate message to the customer.

• If the customer resides at a deliverable zip code, display a message “Delivery available in your area! “.

• Invoke this method from the main function which takes the zip code as input parameter
